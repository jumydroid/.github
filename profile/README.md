# WIP: JuMyDroid - Just My Android

JuMyDroid is a custom Android ROM based on LineageOS with sensible defaults.
The focus is on a vanilla LineageOS experience with enhanced privacy without loss of convenience.

## WARNING: I have to put this project on hold as Android is a huge project and I don't have (and can't buy in the near future) hardware that I can build it on

**Warning:** this is a work a progress in a very early stage
